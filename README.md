## Introduction

Sleep disorders (or sleep-wake disorders) are difficulties with the quality, timing, and quantity of sleep that cause daily discomfort and impairment in functioning. Sleep-wake disturbances are frequently associated with physical or mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or cognitive difficulties. There are various forms of sleep-wake disorders, with insomnia being the most frequent. Other sleep-wake problems include sleep apnea. Insomnia is a common sleep problem that makes it difficult to get asleep and remain asleep. Meanwhile, sleep apnea is a condition in which you stop breathing while asleep.
